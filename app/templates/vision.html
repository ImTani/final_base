        <h2>I. Understanding of the Question:</h2>
        <div class="list-group">
            <div class="list-group-item">
                <h5>(i) What is the Problem?</h5>
                <p>The problem is the lack of a systematic way for households to track the schedule of waste collection trucks or garbage pickers, leading to inefficient waste disposal and inconvenience for residents.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="list-group-item">
                <h5>(ii) Why is this a Problem?</h5>
                <p>This is a problem because without a reliable system, residents may miss waste collection, leading to accumulation and environmental issues. Additionally, not being aware of the garbage picker's proximity can result in unpreparedness for waste disposal.</p>

            <div class="list-group-item">
                <h5>(iii) What are the Different Factors that Create this Problem?</h5>

                    <li>Limited awareness of the waste pickup timings</li>
                    <li>Inefficient communication between waste management services and residents</li>

        <p>All trucks will be equipped with GPS modules. Whenever a truck is in a specified radius from a userâ€™s stored location, pass a notification to the user that the truck is arriving soon and link it to the live location and set route for the pickup truck. All trucks will have prerecorded routes that they have to follow through their specified localities. Each district would have its own pickup truck allotted to it.</p>
        <p>Notifications can either be push notifications or through services (Whatsapp/Telegram). This will depend on the user preference.</p>
